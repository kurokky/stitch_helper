# stitch_helper

This project is an Inkscape extension that facilitates the creation of cross-stitch embroidery patterns. It provides tools to convert images into cross-stitch designs, allowing users to customize stitch types, colors, and pattern sizes directly within Inkscape. This extension aims to simplify the process of designing cross-stitch patterns for embroidery machines.

## Warning

You have to use Ink/Stitch to generate embroidery files from the patterns created with this extension. Ink/Stitch is a separate Inkscape extension that specializes in embroidery design and file generation.
